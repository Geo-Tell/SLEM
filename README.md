# SLEM：Smoothly Varying Projective Transformation for Line Segment Matching

Introduction
=
This is a robust line matching method based on A-sift point correspondences and projective transformation model. The paper and code are available and free to use with proper attribution in your research. It must to be mentioned that the result you run may not correspond with the result in our paper due to the random sampling and some images will take
a long time due to the enormous features and matrix manipulation which can be accelerated by GPUs in the following work.
